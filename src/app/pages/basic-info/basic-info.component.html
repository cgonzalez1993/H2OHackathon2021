        <div class="col-12">
            <p>Critical to aquatic food webs, algae are photosynthetic organisms—in other words, they derive energy for
                growth from the
                sun. An algal bloom is the overgrowth of microscopic algae or algae-like bacteria in fresh, salt, or
                brackish waters.
                Depending on the type of algae or bacteria that cause it, an algal bloom may produce bad-smelling scum,
                foam, froth, or
                a paintlike slick. Algal blooms can be many colors, including blue-green, yellow, brown, pink, and red.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not all algal blooms are toxic, but research indicates that a growing number are. A harmful algal bloom,
                or HAB, is a
                bloom that produces toxins that are dangerous to humans and potentially other organisms.

            <p>You can’t tell if a bloom is harmful just by looking at it, and you can’t easily see all blooms.
                People or pets can get sick when they have contact with harmful algal blooms in these ways:
                Swimming, kayaking, fishing, wading, or doing similar activities in contaminated water.
                Breathing in tiny water droplets, mist, or wind-blown sea spray that contains toxins.
                Drinking contaminated water.
                Eating contaminated seafood (fish or shellfish).

            <b>When in Doubt, Stay Out!</b>

            <p>
                When visiting lakes, rivers, or oceans, check your local water conditions. Follow any advice your state or
                local
                environmental health department posts online or near the water.
                If a health notice is posted or if you suspect a harmful algal bloom may be in the water, follow these
                recommendations:
            </p>
                
            <li>
                Don’t swim or come in direct contact with water that smells bad, looks discolored, or has scum on the surface.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don’t let pets drink, play, or swim in water or eat algae.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stay out of the water if it has dead fish or other dead animals in or near it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Know the health risks of eating contaminated fish and shellfish and follow warnings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Follow guidance from your local health officials if you learn about a harmful algal bloom in your area or if you are notified that your tap water contains algal toxins.
            </li>
